{The GMT active optics control strategies}

abstract = {
The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) has a Gregorian 25.4-meter diameter primary mirror composed of seven 8.4-meter diameter segments. The secondary mirror consists of seven 1.1-meter diameter segments. In the active and adaptive operation modes of the GMT, around a dozen wavefront sensors are selectively used to monitor the optical aberrations across the focal plane. A dedicated wavefront control system drives slow and fast corrections at the M1 and M2 mirrors to deliver image quality optimized for the field of view of the scientific instrument in use. This paper describes the control strategies for the active optics mode of the GMT. Different wavefront estimation algorithm are compared and the performance of the GMT is evaluated using the Dynamic Optical Simulation package.

abstract = {
The Giant Magellan Telescope active optics system is required to maintain image quality across a 20 arcminute diameter field of view. To do so, it must control the positions of the primary mirror and secondary mirror segments, and the figures of the primary mirror segments. When operating with its adaptive secondary mirror, the figure of the secondary is also controlled. Wavefront and fast-guiding measurements are made using a set of four probes deployed around the field of view. Through a set of simulations we have determined a set of modes that will be used to control fielddependent aberrations without degeneracies.

The instrument measures the vertical profile of the optical atmospheric turbulence strength, in 8 resolution elements, to a maximum altitude ranging between 100 and 500 m. We present statistical results of measurements of the turbulence profile on a total of 875 nights between 2014 and 2018. The vertical profile of the ground layer of turbulence is very varied, but in the median case most of the turbulence strength in the ground layer is concentrated within the first 50 m altitude, with relatively weak turbulence at higher altitudes up to 500 m. We find good agreement between measurements of the seeing angle from the SLODAR and from the Paranal DIMM seeing monitor, and also for seeing values extracted from the Shack–Hartmann active optics sensor of Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope 1 (UT1), adjusting for the height of each instrument above ground level. The SLODAR data suggest that a median improvement in the seeing angle from 0.689 to 0.481 arcsec at wavelength 500 nm would be obtained by fully correcting the ground-layer turbulence between the height of the UTs (taken as 10 m) and altitude 500 m.}",
